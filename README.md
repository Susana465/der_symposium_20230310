# Data Hazards, Ethics and Reproducibility One-Day Symposium

## About this event:
The theme of this event can be summarized as "aligning our values with our research: thinking about how to embed ethics and reproducibility into our work".

During this one-day symposium, we will investigate how we may align our values into our research. We will look at how we can embed ethics and reproducibility into our research and not just having them as an add-on. We will look into a Data Hazards framework, and hope to bring together speakers from across different disciplines who integrate data ethics and reproducibility into their research.

This will be a hybrid event, held in person at the Alan Turing Institute HQ (London), and online on Friday 10th March 2023.
